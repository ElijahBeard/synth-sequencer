# Synthesizer & Sequencer
    Authors: Minh Le, Elijah Beard

## Background


This repo contains the schematics and arduino files for our Sequencer Synthesizer. This project was made for the Ohio Universities 2024 Hackathon, and won [best hardware](https://devpost.com/software/step-sequencer-synthesizer).

The synthesizer is broken up into two separate systems. The sequencer (Blue ELEGOO UNO), and the synth engine (Black ELEGOO UNO). These two systems are connected together by 4 lines of each micro-controllers digital pins.

## Synth Engine

The synth engine controller runs on a library called [Mozzi](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/), an open source arduino library for generating complex algorithmic sounds.
