## Background

This repo contains the schematics and arduino files for our Sequencer Synthesizer. This project was made for Ohio University's 2024 Hackathon called BlossomHack, and won [Best Hardware](https://devpost.com/software/step-sequencer-synthesizer).

This was our first time getting into hardware. We had rudimentary knowledge about circuits but had no prior knowledge about arduinos. We have always wanted to experiment and see how hardware and software interact with each other and decided that BlossomHack would be the perfect setting.

The synthesizer is broken up into two separate systems. The sequencer (Blue ELEGOO UNO), and the synth engine (Black ELEGOO UNO). These two systems are connected together by 4 lines of each micro-controllers digital pins. 

## Sequencer

Simple arduino design that aims to mimic a 4-step beat sequencer. Each LED represents a quarter note. There are buttons that corresponds to each LED allowing you to turn the LEDs off and on. Different rhythm patterns can be created by toggling on and off the 4 different LEDs.

## Synth Engine

The synth engine controller runs on a library called [Mozzi](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/), an open source arduino library for generating complex algorithmic sounds.

First, there are 4 digital reads from the sequencer that takes a high read for every note played. In my two example files, these trigger 4 different notes that can be manipulated with the first potentiometer. The other one is for adjusting a filter.

The audio out is connected with pins 10 + 11, soldered to a 1/8th in TRS cable. In our video, that cable is connected to an interface so the sound can be played through my laptop.
